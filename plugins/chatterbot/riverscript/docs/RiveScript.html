<h1>RiveScript</h1>

<hr>

<h1>Methods</h1>

<h2>RiveScript (hash options)</h2>
<br>
Create a new RiveScript interpreter. options is a hash:<br>
<br>
bool debug:     Debug mode            (default false)<br>
int  depth:     Recursion depth limit (default 50)<br>
bool strict:    Strict mode           (default true)<br>
str  debug_div: ID of an element to write debug lines to (optional)

<hr>

<h2>float version ()</h2>

<br>
Return the version number of the RiveScript.js library.<hr>

<h2>private void runtime ()</h2>

<br>
Detect the runtime environment of this module, to determine if we're<br>
running in a web browser or from NodeJS for example.<hr>

<h2>private void say (string message)</h2>

<br>
This is the debug function. If debug mode is enabled, the 'message' will be<br>
sent to the console via console.log (if available), or to your debug div if<br>
you defined one.<br>
<br>
@param message: A message to add to the debug log.<hr>

<h2>private void warn (string message)</h2>

<br>
Print a warning or error message. This is like debug, except it's GOING to be<br>
given to the user one way or another. If the debug div is defined, this is<br>
written to it. If console is defined, the error will be sent there. In a<br>
worst case scenario, an alert box is shown.<hr>

<h2>int loadFile (string path || array path[, on_success[, on_error]])</h2>

<br>
Load a RiveScript document from a file. The path can either be a string<br>
that contains the path to a single file, or an array of paths to load<br>
multiple files. on_success is a function to be called when the file(s)<br>
have been successfully loaded. on_error is for catching any errors, such<br>
as syntax errors.<br>
<br>
This loading method is asyncronous. You should define an on_success<br>
handler to be called when the file(s) have been successfully loaded.<br>
<br>
This method returns the "batch number" for this load attempt. The first<br>
call to this function will have a batch number of 0 and that will go<br>
up from there. This batch number is passed to your on_success handler<br>
as its only argument, in case you want to correlate it with your call<br>
to loadFile.<br>
<br>
on_success receives: int batch_count<br>
on_error receives: string error_message<hr>

<h2>void loadDirectory (string path[, func on_success[, func on_error]])</h2>

<br>
Load RiveScript documents from a directory.<br>
<br>
This function is not supported in a web environment. Only for<br>
NodeJS.<hr>

<h2>bool stream (string code[, func on_error])</h2>

<br>
Stream in RiveScript code dynamically. 'code' should be the raw<br>
RiveScript source code as a string (with line breaks after each line).<br>
<br>
This function is synchronous, meaning there is no success handler<br>
needed. It will return false on parsing error, true otherwise.<br>
<br>
on_error receives: string error_message<hr>

<h2>private bool parse (string name, string code[, func on_error])</h2>

<br>
Parse RiveScript code and load it into memory. 'name' is a file name in<br>
case syntax errors need to be pointed out. 'code' is the source code,<br>
and 'on_error' is a function to call when a syntax error occurs.<hr>

<h2>string checkSyntax (char command, string line)</h2>

<br>
Check the syntax of a RiveScript command. 'command' is the single<br>
character command symbol, and 'line' is the rest of the line after<br>
the command.<br>
<br>
Returns an empty string on success, or a description of the error<br>
on error.<hr>

<h2>void sortReplies ()</h2>

<br>
After you have finished loading your RiveScript code, call this method to<br>
populate the various sort buffers. This is absolutely necessary for<br>
reply matching to work efficiently!<hr>

<h2>void setHandler (string lang, object)</h2>

<br>
Set a custom language handler for RiveScript objects. See the source for<br>
the built-in JavaScript handler as an example.<br>
<br>
@param lang: The lowercased name of the programming language, e.g. perl, python<br>
@param obj:  A JavaScript object that has functions named "load" and "call".<br>
Use the undefined value to delete a language handler.<hr>

<h2>void setSubroutine (string name, function)</h2>

<br>
Define a JavaScript object from your program.<br>
<br>
This is equivalent to having a JS object defined in the RiveScript code, except<br>
your JavaScript code is defining it instead.<hr>

<h2>void setGlobal (string name, string value)</h2>

<br>
Set a global variable. This is equivalent to '! global' in RiveScript.<br>
Set the value to undefined to delete a global.<hr>

<h2>void setVariable (string name, string value)</h2>

<br>
Set a bot variable. This is equivalent to '! var' in RiveScript.<br>
Set the value to undefined to delete a variable.<hr>

<h2>void setSubstitution (string name, string value)</h2>

<br>
Set a substitution. This is equivalent to '! sub' in RiveScript.<br>
Set the value to undefined to delete a substitution.<hr>

<h2>void setPerson (string name, string value)</h2>

<br>
Set a person substitution. This is equivalent to '! person' in RiveScript.<br>
Set the value to undefined to delete a substitution.<hr>

<h2>void setUservar (string user, string name, string value)</h2>

<br>
Set a user variable for a user.<hr>

<h2>string getUservar (string user, string name)</h2>

<br>
Get a variable from a user. Returns the string "undefined" if it isn't<br>
defined.<hr>

<h2>data getUservars ([string user])</h2>

<br>
Get all variables about a user. If no user is provided, returns all<br>
data about all users.<hr>

<h2>void clearUservars ([string user])</h2>

<br>
Clear all a user's variables. If no user is provided, clears all variables<br>
for all users.<hr>

<h2>void freezeUservars (string user)</h2>

<br>
Freeze the variable state of a user. This will clone and preserve the user's<br>
entire variable state, so that it can be restored later with thawUservars().<hr>

<h2>void thawUservars (string user[, string action])</h2>

<br>
Thaws a user's frozen variables. The action can be one of the following:<br>
- discard: Don't restore the variables, just delete the frozen copy.<br>
- keep:    Keep the frozen copy after restoring.<br>
- thaw:    Restore the variables and delete the frozen copy (default)<hr>

<h2>void lastMatch (string user)</h2>

<br>
Retrieve the trigger that the user matched most recently.<hr>

<h2>string reply (string username, string message)</h2>

<br>
Fetch a reply from the RiveScript brain. The message doesn't require any<br>
special pre-processing to be done to it, i.e. it's allowed to contain<br>
punctuation and weird symbols. The username is arbitrary and is used to<br>
uniquely identify the user, in the case that you may have multiple<br>
distinct users chatting with your bot.<hr>
